### Stuff you need

This theme was cobbled together with oh-my-bash in mind. Go get it from here: https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash

You have to install one of the nerd fonts found here:
https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

And also put it as the active font in your terminal.

The theme folder goes into ```~/.oh-my-bash/themes/```
